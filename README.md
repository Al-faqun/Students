# Students
Educational project: you can **browse** list of students, use **search**, add **your** own data, which will give you cookie token, so you could **edit** your 'Student profile' later.

We use mysql/MariaDB with two tables: one holding data about **profiles**, another manipulates **password** hashes.
Since markdown is such an ass and does not know tabulation and indentation, I would not write further here.
